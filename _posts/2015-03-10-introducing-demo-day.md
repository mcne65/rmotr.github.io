We're thrilled to announce that rmotr.com will be hosting a **Demo Day**.

**Demo Day** is a presentation from the [Advanced Python Programming](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/advanced-python-programming-course-tickets-15084732842) course students of a project they have coded over a period of two weeks. They'll have to demo it in front of a panel of industry leaders that will act as jury and mentors, providing feedback and suggestions.

**Demo Day event (watch live!):** [https://plus.google.com/events/cdoh02tdbucp00dv670dt3nd26o](https://plus.google.com/events/cdoh02tdbucp00dv670dt3nd26o)

## Motivation

One of the biggest values we provide at [rmotr.com](http://rmotr.com/) is that we teach things that are not just taught in books. We teach the hard things about programming. It's easy to learn how to code a for-loop in Python, or how to create a webapp using Flask. The hard things involve estimates, how to deal with people and team-work, good practices, etc. Even though our course involves features and concepts of Python, our main goal is to transfer all our experience to our students. Demo Day is the _Summum_ of that experience. Our students will have to transfer all the knowledge gathered throughout the course and put it in one project that will count with the judging eye of professional coders.

On top of that we have hard requirements that they have to meet. It's not an easy experience, it involves a lot of stress, but we're confident about our students and their hard work. 

You could think about Demo Day like a controlled experiment where our students have the chance to try themselves in a real life-like environment. The project follows real life practices and our jury is tenacious in that aspect.

## Requirements

We impose some requirements that we believe are key in order to achieve the previously stated goals. These requirements are the result of constant evolution and joint work with the jury members and mentors.

**Clearly defined scope:** Before the students even begin to write the code for their project they must create a document where they state what the software will do and at what extent. We don't care what it is, but we need a defined scope. This will be used by the jury after seeing the end result to evaluate the estimations of the team.

**Tested and documented**: _Reading code is more important than writing code._ Along those lines understanding what the software does and validating that it does it in the right way is even more important. Students will have the chance to test themselves to see if the level of documentation they provide is enough for their peers and the jury. The jury will also check the testing level and techniques used, providing valuable feedback in this matter.

**Production level. Detail oriented**: We don't care if the project has a small scope. But we do care a lot that it's ready for production and has a professional finish touch. We prefer to have a small project that's solid than a big project that is flawed and half-finished. That's what differentiates greats coders; the professionalism they have in their work. We want to foster this aspect in our students.

**It must use a public API:** We're sick of "library systems". We want something real that provides value. We don't care what: grab tweets, reddit posts, Foursquare locations, YouTube videos or statistics. We want to see real value in the project. Plus, using a public API makes our students face the truth behind systems: they might be poorly documented, they might break, etc.

## How it works

As everything we do on rmotr.com, Demo Day is a remote event. It'll be hosted using Google Hangouts on Air. The presenting team, the Jury and members of rmotr.com will be hosting the HO while it'll be watched by the audience live. Each team will have to present their project by introducing its objective and the scope they chose. The jury will have time to play around with the app and will ask questions and provide feedback to the team.
