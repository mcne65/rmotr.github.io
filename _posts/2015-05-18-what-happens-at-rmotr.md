rmotr.com is not just a programming course; it's a **complete environment** where students from all around the world gather in order to learn how to code. Even though you have one class of two hours per week the action keeps going 24/7.

### You make friends

We believe that communication and human interaction is key in order to create a great learning experience. That's why it's the center of our process. You'll be working 6 weeks side by side with your classmates. We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as our main communication hub; everything happens on slack. We have several channels based on different interests. Each class has its own private group where students are constantly interacting.

Also mentors and teacher is always present ready to answer questions and helping students.

**It doesn't matter if it's 4AM in a Saturday morning. There's always someone connected working on something and ready to help.**

### You learn by doing

The only way to learn how to code is by coding. It's a slow and painful process at the start; but with help and support from teachers, mentors and classmates you'll be up to speed soon. Our classes are focused mainly in practical examples and exercises (some are big projects that encompass several topics). We use pair programming in order to foster collaboration. Pair programming is amazing to avoid you getting stuck without a solution and to brainstorm ideas.

### You learn the things that are not taught on books

Learning Python syntax is easy. Doing a for-loop is easy. Judging if you should use a dictionary or a list or creating a special hierarchy for your classes is hard. Your teachers are professional experts in the field; they make a living as professional coders. That's why **they can transmit real world experiences, things that are not taught in books.**. Should you use integration tests or unit tests? Will memory footprint will have an impact for this application? PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis? All these things are hard to learn by yourself; experience is the best teacher.

We use real life tools: Linux, Github, Travis, Docker, etc. We stick to industry standards so when you're out of your class you take all that knowledge with you.

### You have Demo Day!

Once the course is over you'll have to use all the knowledge that you gathered during the course in a big integral project. It **must be a working application that solves a real problem**. After 2 weeks working on it with your group you present it in front of a jury which will give you feedback and recommendations. From our experience Demo Day is the most exciting part of the course; is where our students put themselves to test.
