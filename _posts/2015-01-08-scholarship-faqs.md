**What type of scholarships do you provide?**

Full scholarships. If you're selected the course is free.

**How do I apply?**

Submit this application: [http://goo.gl/forms/PzlAanzDYf](http://goo.gl/forms/PzlAanzDYf)

Please read these FAQ before applying.

**What's the admissions process?**

There are three phases of our admissions process:

1. An application.
2. An interview with other possible candidates.
3. Homework to submit after the interview.

The first step is to submit a brief written application. After that, you will either receive an invitation to interview or an e-mail notifying you were not selected for this batch. Don't worry too much though. We'll keep doing them and people who's not selected in the first place get more chances in the following batches.

If you are invited to interview, you'll be sent an invitation to join the interview. The first interview is a general conversation between the possible candidates and the instructors. We introduce ourselves and hangout to know more about ourselves: why you want to learn to code, what's your experience, what are your interests, etc. We won't ask you to do any coding but the conversation might involve things related to coding, projects you've worked in the past and general nerdy things.

After that you'll receive an email asking you to follow to the next step or an email indicating that you were not selected for this batch. Again, don't worry too much. You're really close for the upcoming batch.

The next step involves submitting homework. It varies depending on the type of course you are. It might be a program (for more advanced courses) or a small essay regarding technology for starters.

**Why do you have such a hard admissions process?**

We need commitment. As you might read below we don't care if you're technically gifted. We want awesome people who commits and be present as long as the course runs. People dropping out soon ruins the experience for everybody else.

**When is the deadline to submit applications?**

Sunday, January 11th, 2015.

**What do you take into account to select students?**

PEOPLE. PEOPLE. PEOPLE. We want good, committed, hard-working, humble people. We want people that are willing to help fellow classmates and be deeply committed with the class.

We also value social aspects. How have you helped people before? What are your plans to make this a better world (as small as can be)? how have you contributed to open source projects? (even if you can't code).

**Can I bribe the judges?**

Sadly no, those times are over. But if you want to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rmotr_com) or like us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rmotr) we'll be really happy!

**What happens if I don't get selected?**

Don't worry too much. We're going to keep doing the courses. You'll be selected soon enough.

**Can you tell me why I wasn't admitted or give me feedback on my application?**

We can't. Most of the time there's nothing "bad". Just other people were given the priority for this time. Your turn will come.

**I have other question and I don't see it answered here**

Please send it to questions@rmotr.com and we'll happily answer it. Plus, you will help us to improve this page :)
