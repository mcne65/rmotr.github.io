These are just FAQs. If you want to know why and how we do scholarships please read: [http://blog.rmotr.com/announcements/2015/03/29/new-scholarship-model/](http://blog.rmotr.com/announcements/2015/03/29/new-scholarship-model/)

**What type of scholarships do you provide?**

Full scholarships. If you're selected the entire course is free.

**What's the admissions process?**

There are three simple steps for our admissions process:

1. An application.
2. A follow up resolution problem that might include team work.
3. An interview with other possible candidates.


The first step is to submit a brief written application. The application might contain a simple programming exercise that will be used to know your programming skills. After the first application we'll be sending a follow up exercise. Neither of these exercises are deal breakers. We just ask for them in order to create groups of students with similar levels of knowledge. Once the follow up exercises are submitted we evaluate all candidates. 

After that, you will either receive an invitation to interview or an e-mail notifying you were not selected for this batch. Don't worry too much though. We'll keep doing them and people who's not selected in the first place get more chances in the following batches.

If you are invited to interview, you'll be sent an invitation to join the interview. The first interview is a general conversation between the possible candidates and the instructors. We introduce ourselves and hangout to know more about ourselves: why you want to learn to code, what's your experience, what are your interests, etc. We won't ask you to do any coding but the conversation might involve things related to coding, projects you've worked in the past and general nerdy things.

**Why do you have such a hard admissions process?**

We need commitment. As you might read below we don't care if you're technically gifted. We want awesome people who commits and be present as long as the course runs. People dropping out soon ruins the experience for everybody else.

**What do you take into account to select students?**

PEOPLE. PEOPLE. PEOPLE. We want good, committed, hard-working, humble people. We want people that are willing to help fellow classmates and be deeply committed with the class.

We also value social aspects. How have you helped people before? What are your plans to make this a better world (as small as can be)? how have you contributed to open source projects? (even if you can't code).

**Can I bribe the judges?**

Sadly no, those times are over. But if you want to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/rmotr_com) or like our page on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rmotr) we'll be really happy!

**What happens if I don't get selected?**

Don't worry too much. We're going to keep doing the courses. You'll be selected soon enough.

**Can you tell me why I wasn't admitted or give me feedback on my application?**

We can't. Most of the time there's nothing "bad". Just other people were given the priority for this time. Your turn will come eventually.

**I have other question and I don't see it answered here**

Please send it to questions@rmotr.com and we'll happily answer it. Plus, you will help us to improve this page :)
