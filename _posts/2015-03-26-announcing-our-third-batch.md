We're happy to announce that the third batch for our flagship course [Advanced Programming with Python](http://bit.ly/rmotr-3rd-batch) is now open.

**The big deal about this batch is that we're announcing our new [scholarship model](#).** That means you can apply for a full scholarship here: [http://goo.gl/forms/SNawvSVs3x](http://goo.gl/forms/SNawvSVs3x)

Of course if you just want to jump in and pay for it you don't have to pass through all the application process. The scholarships are meant for people who really need them and we're going to prioritize that.

### Objectives

The main objective of this batch (aside from testing the scholarship model) is to improve our class content and methodology. We're going to foster self-learning and group work (even more). We firmly believe that group work is the best way to learn. Our Demo Day has proven us right; our students have put so much effort in order to put together their final project that it greatly surpass whatever we can teach.

Other objective is to strength our community. Slack has proven to be a great tool to keep provide collaboration for all the past and present rmotr students. People keep engaging in our channels and magical things happen in there.
