We're happy to announce that we just opened our second batch for both of our courses:

* [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-programming-with-python-tickets-15062686902)
* [Advanced Python Programming](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/advanced-python-programming-course-tickets-15084732842)

**There are just 6 openings for each course.** We know it's not too much. But our goal with this courses still applies: Provide the best experience possible. We dedicate a huge amount of time to our students to give them a valuable experience.

### Objectives

Our objectives for this batch are:

* Improve the practice time for students. There will be one class per week where we're going to focus on practice and assignments only.
* Polish the contents. Thanks to the feedback we got from our previous students we can keep our contents sharp.
* Enhance communication. New tools like Slack will allow us to improve the communication in our courses so we can create private and public groups of people.
* Better tracking of our students. We'll introduce a rating system. We'll keep close track of our students' performance and will give them an after-course evaluation and certificate.

### Stay tuned

We'll have some news in the following days regarding scholarships and exciting announcements. Stay tunned:
