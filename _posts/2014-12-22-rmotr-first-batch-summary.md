Some time ago we had a crazy idea: creating [a remote programming course]({% post_url 2014-12-12-introducing-rmotr %}). We knew that it was a bold (and kind of revolutionary) venture and we needed to put our thoughts to test. That's why we came up with the idea of create different "batches". Each batch would be a group of people that would participate in rmotr.com. Every batch would be used to learn and to improve our methodology. The big advantage of getting into action from day one was that we'd learn directly from our students, not from "theoretical" analysis or studies. **The course was entirely free**. We knew we had to learn a lot and it didn't feel right to charge people. It was the perfect mutualism; we'd put a lot of effort trying to teach people, giving the best of us; that'd benefit students. While they'd help us providing their honest feedback and supporting us in order to improve.

Without further ado, this is the summary of our first batch at rmotr.com.

We decided we'd teach two courses:

* **Introduction to programming using Python (G1)**: The primary focus would be to teach "how to program". We'd use Python as a tool, but Python itself would not be the main focus of the course.
* **Python programming course (G2)**: Aimed for people who already knew how to code, the objective of this course was to teach Python in deep, finishing with some web applications. From basic function definitions to web programming.

We created three groups; two G1's and one G2. Each group consisted of about 8 people. 

We started the first batch on September 29th, 2014. The main focus of this batch was to **validate that we were providing a great learning experience, better than traditional online courses**. We also wanted to learn the best tools to make the process as smooth as possible. Here are more details about it...

## Development platform

We chose [Cloud9](http://c9.io) as our IDE. Cloud9 provides a collaborative editor which makes it really simple to do joint work. Students can all work on the same file collaborating and working together. It also has a unix-like interface (it runs Ubuntu underneath) which is really cool to introduce students to linux platforms (which is really important to know for programmers).

One huge win was the fact that **we avoided entirely the need to do initial setups**, the environment was ready to start on the first class. We know how students get demoralized when things start to break and it gets hard to install/configure new software. Students' main focus from day 1 was to learn how to code, not how to install/configure Python, text editor, databases, etc.

## Google hangouts

We used Google Hangouts to conduct the class. It's a really simple tool and everybody has access to it; all you need is a Google account. Plus it has features to share screen, mute people, drawing apps, etc. It was the simplest solution and it proved to be the best one.

For one of the G1 courses we used Hangouts on Air, which makes recordings of the Hangout and provided the students the ability to watch again any class they want.

## Google Communities

Each group had a private Google community in which they could participate and share stuff. It was really useful because every guy would share cool stuff she/he'd find and it was also helpful for us for communication. We posted all our announcements in there.

Along with Cloud9, Google Hangouts and Google communities we also used Google Drive (to share documents like recommended readings and syllabus).

## The results

Based on our [students' feedback](http://rmotr.com/#testimonials) the course was a great SUCCESS. The highest points people noted were:

* **Speed of learning:** Overall students said that in the same time the course lasted they had learned way more than with online courses or videos. It proved to be a more efficient process.

* **Human interaction:** Students valued the human interaction both with the teacher and also with other classmates. Being able to ask a question when they didn't get a specific topic was important. Also being able to create discussions with other students was really helpful to learn.

* **Small groups:** Classes never exceeded 8 people, which make it a really personal course. Every student knew his/her classmates' names and how to interact with them. People got to know each other. Go to the bottom of this page for a cool related story.

* **Lots of practice:** We believe that the best way to learn how to code is coding. Our course was highly practical and students loved it. Every discussed topic was accompanied by practice exercise to do in groups during class (with the teacher assisting and providing feedback).

## The bads

Not all went so smoothly. We learned that it's really hard to coordinate students to work together outside of the class. That's our main focus of improvement for our next batch (stay tuned).

We made some mistakes regarding timing and scheduling. In the middle of the course Daylight Saving Times happened, which totally screwed up 1 class (some people missed it). It's hard to coordinate timings with people around the world.

Finally some people dropped out; when we started we didn't know how much it'd last and students attending to college started with finals, which pretty much destroyed their extra time. Even though we had drop outs, most of them were justified and people that dropped were really interested in joining on the next batch.

## The coolest thing

We had a group of students that got along really well and it encouraged them to keep working together after the course was finished. One of them had an idea for a product he wanted to develop and invited some mates to join the project. It was really cool to see that we could set the foundations for people to make friends and meet partners.

## The future

We're currently starting with Batch 2. Our primary focus is to improve offline work. We have some ideas, so stay tuned to know more: [rmotr.com](http://rmotr.com).
