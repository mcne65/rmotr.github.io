At rmotr.com we believe in universal access to education. Just making something "remote" makes it greatly accessible. Avoiding commute times, relocations, physical barriers is our number one advantage. We also want to provide education to everybody; regardless of the resources that each person can have.

rmotr.com started as a free course. We were greatly surprised with the engagement and compromise our students had, even though it was free (people argued that our students wouldn't be really committed if they'd not pay for it). We started to get involved with our students and found amazing stories: people trying to make a better living, adults that were being reunited with programming after several years, kids trying to learn to program games, among others. That transformed rmotr.com from being just a bunch of hypothesis and the idea of a business to be a real passion and our mission to bring education to everybody.

To continue with that mission we have found a way to finance ourselves in order to keep providing scholarships so people can access our courses for free. We want to give everybody the same opportunities; regardless of the resources they have available.

**For every course we do, we're going to have 4 scholarships, that's half of each course (there are 8 openings per course).**

### Requisites

Everybody can apply. People with fewer resources will have a priority; people that really need it. Aside from that we'll value:

**Committment:** This is the single most important trait we're aiming to get right. We don't care much about people "skilled" for programming. We want committed people that's willing to put hard work into it. People avid to learn and participate.

**Givers:** We love givers. We love people with the willingness to give to others, to share and help. After all what we're building is a community and people who give and help will be highly appreciated. Actions like contributing to open source projects, helping other people over forums, being able to answer questions, among others will be taken into account.

**Passion:** This is related to the previous statements, but nevertheless it deserves it's own point. Passionate people is what makes this world better. We're constantly surprised by people writing at 4AM in the morning asking for help with something or sharing something cool they've done.

**We believe in taking education everywhere and making it available for everyone.**
