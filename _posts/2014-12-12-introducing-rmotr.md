Rmotr.com is an online platform that provides a remote classroom where people from all around the world can learn how to code. Think of rmotr.com like a remote bootcamp with a **real teacher, real classmates and real assignments.**

At rmotr.com we want to create remote courses that combine the best from the physical and the online worlds providing a great experience between a college-like education and a fully-online course.

## Why?

The options you've today to learn how to code are either: going into a physical bootcamp or college, or using fully online platforms (like codecademy, coursera, etc).

**College is great because it provides human interaction**: you meet classmates, you make friends, you work along with other people and have mentors and teachers who'll have a big influence in your life. **The problem is that it's generally really expensive and it's not accessible to everyone**: you have to be in a particular geographic location, you have to commit to a great deal of time, etc.

**Online courses are great because they lower the entrance barrier** for people that can't get into college or physical bootcamps. They're generally cheaper, can be done from virtually every place in the world and the time committed is decided by the student (you can keep your regular job, family life, etc). **The problem is that they lack the fundamentals of education...**

## Learning to code is not about the syntax

This might surprise new programmers, but: learning how to code is not about learning the syntax of a programming language. Programming languages are tools and it's important first to learn why and how to use those tools. **Your goal as a coder should be to learn the concepts of programming in general**. Once you know how/when/why to use an _if statement_, then you can write it in Python, Ruby, Javascript, Go or whatever language you want to choose.

We believe that learning the concepts of programming and computers in general, learning how to interact with fellow programmers, where and how to get help, lose the fear to make mistakes (among other things) are the fundamentals that will create a solid base for a good coder.

Surprisingly, most online courses focus on the syntax of programming languages, leaving aside all the important topics mentioned above. Online courses just have a "right"/"wrong" approach for computer-recorded exercises that are not really helpful for new programmers.

## There's no such thing as "right" or "wrong"

Just as it doesn't exist "bad" or "good" (it's just a matter of interpretation), in programming **there should not be "right" or "wrong" things. It just depends on the situation**. Why should you use a tuple instead of a list in python? Why should you use == or === in javascript? Those questions don't have a "right" or "wrong" answer: they'll just make more sense in one situation than the other. Passing on that type of judgment is key in order to train great developers and the only way to do it is having an experience person/teacher trying to explain it to you.

## The only way we know to learn how to code

**Smashing your head against the wall over and over again**. The number one way to learn how to code is coding. And this sounds ridiculous, but it's true: practice is the only way to learn. The problem is that when you're starting it's really hard to get practice time. Every single problem you find in your path can demoralize you and make you quit. That's why our classes are highly practical; every topic explained involves exercises to do along with your classmates. Plus, if any problem or question arises the teacher is right there to help you keep making progress.

## Students are the best teachers

We all know this from some previous experience: The best teachers are generally other classmates that already get the subject we're trying to understand. Other students understand your learning process because they were there just some time ago. In contrast, teachers and professors already know every single topic and sometimes it's hard for them to take it down to a student-digestible level. Your coding buddy will share your language, will have your trust and will know how you think and how you process new things. We find that these experiences are really important when trying to learn new concepts: in every class we stumble upon those situations where the teacher tries to communicate some topic and fails to do so, and some student steps up and put it in a different way and make it clear for the entire class. We don't want to lose that. We want to encourage that. That's why we believe so strongly in human interaction and in remote classrooms where you're not learning alone.

## Finally, we love remote working

Remote working is here to stay. More and more companies and institution all over the world are relying on remote work. It makes it really simple to assist to class (you just need your laptop and a decent Internet connection) and there's no need for commuting, which consumes time and money. Plus, having people from all over the world is fascinating and creates an amazing learning experience. Students from Europe, US, Asia, Latin America join to work together as if they'd be side by side. The results are just marvelous.
