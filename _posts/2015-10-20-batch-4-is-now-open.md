We're glad to announce that our new batch is now open. **There are several changes for this batch**, you can read below for more details, but here's the summary:

* **Everyone has to apply**. We have too many people trying to take our courses that we got to the point to do a selection. Either if you're willing to pay or applying for a scholarship you'll need to go through the application process.
* **Scholarships are still open**. We restate our commitment with **free** education.
* **More mentors, new technology and more goodies.**
* Any doubt? **Email us!**: [questions@rmotr.com](mailto:questions@rmotr.com)

## You'll have to apply now

All the people will need to apply to take our courses now. We're proud to have lots of folks trying to join our course but it also means that we have to do some filtering beforehand. We've seen how an internal culture has developed and we'd like to keep it that way. Don't worry that applications aren't to harsh. **We're just trying to get the most committed people. People willing to learn and help others.**

## Scholarships are still open

We've come a long way since the first days. Now we have a huge demand for our course with lots of people willing to pay. Nevertheless our commitment with free education is still intact. Our [scholarships model](/announcements/2015/03/29/new-scholarship-model/) is still going and is our main source of gratification. **Giving people the chance to learn programming and make a living out of it is what keeps us going every day**. We can't even being to express what it feels like when someone tells you _"you've changed my life"_.

Said that, it's important to mention that scholarships are going to be granted to **people that really need them**. We have a huge demand for our courses and even more for scholarships, so we've come to the point to become really rigorous with the application process. We're going to do in depth due diligence to assess who deserve the scholarship.

## How to apply for scholarships?

Just [apply as a regular student](https://sis.rmotr.com/applications) and in the last step tell us you want to apply for a scholarship. Tell us why you think you deserve it.

## More mentors

Starting this batch we've made the commitment to have mentors available 24*7. We know that **to learn programming you have to spend time coding** and from time to time doubts arise. There will be video conferencing rooms available all the time so you can just pop in and ask or discuss whatever is in your mind. Our dream is to reassemble a real programming academy but entirely remote. Just as you'd pop up your head in a room in a real physical academy, you could do it here joining the video conference room for support.

## New technology and more goodies

We've developed internal tools to support our classes that will make your life easier. We're integrating from day one with Github so all the assignments you complete are going to take the form of a Github repo. That means that when you finish this course you'll have tons of code in your Github profile to prove how much you've work in the past month and a half.
