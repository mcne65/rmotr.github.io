This is a step by step guide to help you setup your Github account and get the group projects done.

### Step 1: Identify your team repository

You and your team will share a repository for your group project. This repo is created in our organization, but **it belongs only to you and your team**. You'll have permissions to push code and make modifications as you wish.

### Step 2: Fork it. Create your own personal copy

In order for you to work in an organized way with your teammates you'll be making your own personal copy of the team repo. That way you can be sure you won't be stepping in each other toes.

To fork just hit the Fork button in the team repo. (We're still in the org-level repo. The red arrow marks the fork button):

Once you've forked the repository a personal copy has been created. Note that now it's inside your own Github profile (marked with red):

### Step 3: Start coding!

There are different options you can choose now. You can clone and develop locally in your own environment or you can use Cloud9 to develop. To learn more please follow the other guide: [Use Cloud9 to develop](/students/2015/12/26/step-by-step-guide-to-configure-cloud9-for-group-projects/)
